[LinkUS](https://linkuscolumbus.com/) is a regional planning initiative for transit and non-car mobility in Central Ohio. LinkUS proposes:

- build 3 bus rapid transit lines by 2030 
- build 2 other rapid transit lines by 2030, which may not be bus-based
- provide an estimated $60 million per year for construction of sidewalks and bike paths within the COTA service area
- add more COTA//Plus on-demand transit zones
- add 45% more COTA service hours compared to 2019 service levels

Long-term funding for LinkUS is dependent upon a [0.5% sales tax increase measure](https://www.cota.com/blog/cota-board-approves-ballot-measure-to-expand-transit-and-provide-more-access-to-sidewalks-bikeways/) on the November 2024 ballot. 

LinkUS is led by the [Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission](https://www.morpc.org/), the [Central Ohio Transit Authority](https://cota.com/), and the City of Columbus, but includes stakeholders from across 15 counties.
