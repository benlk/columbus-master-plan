[This confusingly-named plan](https://blueprintneighborhoods.com/) is about building infrastructure to reduce stormwater runoff and sewer backups. This program uses lateral lining, gutter diversion, sump pumps, permeable pavers, and rain gardens to appropriately direct excess water.

The project is based in Columbus' 2005 Wet Weather Management plan, which was designed to bring Columbus into compliance with Ohio EPA consent orders regarding sanitary sewer overflows and combined sewer overflows.
