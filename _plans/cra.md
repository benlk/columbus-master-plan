Columbus' [residential tax incentive program](https://www.columbus.gov/Services/Housing-Assistance-Programs/Apply-for-Residential-Tax-Incentives) reduces property taxes for specific forms of new-build residential properties. The program is reassessed yearly. This program is controversial due to the way it reduces revenue for Columbus City Schools, and praised for creating lots of affordable housing.
