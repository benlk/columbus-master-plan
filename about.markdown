This website is a personal hobby project by [Ben Keith](https://benlk.com/), a Columbus resident who finds the City's websites inadequate for many purposes.

## Credits

This website was built using [the US Web Design Standards Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This site uses [File:Flag of Columbus, Ohio](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Columbus,_Ohio.svg) from Wikimedia Commons, created by Alex43223. This file is a public-domain work, because it was published (or registered with the U.S. Copyright Office) before January 1, 1929.

[WebsiteHeroImage-May2024-MN.png](/assets/columbus/img/WebsiteHeroImage-May2024-MN.png) is copied from the Columbus.gov homepage. I believe that, as a work product of the City of Columbus, it qualifies as a public record.
