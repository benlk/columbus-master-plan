# Welcome to the code behind the Columbus Master Plans unofficial website

Thanks for your interest!

## Scope

## Suggesting improvements

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/benlk/columbus-master-plans/issues/new/choose) and provide a detailed description of what needs to happen. There's a specific template for suggesting new plans.

## Testing

If you can run Jekyll locally, please test build your site to make sure that it compiles and that your changes are correct.

## Submitting changes

Please send [a GitHub Pull Request to this repository](https://github.com/benlk/columbus-master-plans/pull/new/master) with a clear list of changes made (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). If you're making changes to CSS, JS, or HTML, please follow the existing code standards with regards to indentation. 

If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.
